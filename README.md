# ignite-ovo-hack-app
This is an application aimed at getting people to warm up properly. This app was created as an entry for the ovo energy hackathon 2018

This app uses the users age to calculate the maximum heart rate (220 - age).

The definition of warmed up for this app is a heart rate more than 50% of the users maximum heart rate.
Also that the gyroscope has been rotated more than a certain point (a naive attempt at detecting stretching).
